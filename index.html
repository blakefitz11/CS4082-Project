            I am a student teacher at the University of Limerick, currently pursuing a degree in education with a 
            focus on mathematics and computer science. Passionate about shaping the future through teaching, I am 
            dedicated to helping students develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding 
            of both subjects. My goal is to create engaging, accessible, and innovative learning experiences that 
            inspire the next generation of learners in an increasingly digital world.

            One of my favourite projects that a completed in my studies, is a assignment I completed for a module called 
            Computer Software 2. The brief for this assignment was to recreate the DVD screensaver. This project is one 
            of my favourites because it is a visual culmination of my knowledge of java and experience with JFrames to 
            achieve the brief.

            Looking forward, upon my graduation I hope to start teaching immediately. My goal is to work hard to achieve
            a full-time contract within my first five years of teaching. Once this is achieve I hope to be in a position 
            to begin further study in the field of adolescent psychology. I will achieve this by undertaking a masters in 
            Guidance Councilling and following it with a masters in clinical/adolescent psychology. Completeing this would 
            allow my to either continue in education or pivot into a career in the healthcare sector. <br> <br> How does
            computer science fit into this? I plan on teaching Computer Science at Leaving Certificate and Coding at Junior 
            Cycle whilst I remain in the education. These skills also will provide a degree of future proofing of my career 
            as digital literacy and computational thinking will become more prevelant in the education sector in the coming
            years.

            This portfolio reflects my journey so far as a student teacher and aspiring educator in maths and computer science. 
            If I were to expand the site, I would add sections showcasing lesson plans, teaching philosophy, and a blog to 
            document my experiences. With more web development skills, I'd implement interactive elements, such as embedded 
            coding challenges or dynamic project showcases, to make the site more engaging and reflective of my skills.
